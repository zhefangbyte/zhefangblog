I encountered an error when building the Flutter app for Android:
```powershell
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':gradle:compileGroovy'.

```
I searched for so many forums and solutions, and finally, I found out that it was the proxy of Gradle that made an error. As you can see, on the last line of the output above, `127.0.0.1:7890` is exactly the proxy that Gradle was using.
### How to fix it?
Open the file located at `C:\Users\<your_user_name>\.gradle\gradle.properties`.

You will see some lines like:
```properties
systemProp.http.proxyHost=127.0.0.1
systemProp.http.proxyPort=7890
```
Delete all of them and everything will be OK!

If you still find some errors related to the proxy, here are some other things you may look at:
- Git
- Environment variables
- Android Studio
